The basic concept behind a movie recommendation system is quite simple. In particular, there are two main elements in every recommender system: users and items. The system generates movie predictions for its users, while items are the movies themselves.

The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The ML algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the systemâ€™s database. This data is used to predict the future behavior of the user concerned based on the information from the past.
